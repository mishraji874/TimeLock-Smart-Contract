# TimeLock Smart Contract

This smart contract implements a time-based authorization mechanism known as a TimeLock. It allows delaying the execution of transactions for a predefined period, ensuring an extra layer of security and control over critical operations within your decentralized application.

## Features:

1. **Time-Delayed Execution:** Transactions are queued and can only be executed after a specified delay.
2. **Enhanced Security:** Mitigates the risk of accidental or unauthorized transactions by introducing a wait time.
3. **Customizable Delays:** The minimum and maximum delay durations are configurable through contract parameters.
4. **Foundry Integration:** Leverages the Foundry framework for efficient development and testing.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/mishraji874/TimeLock-Smart-Contract.git
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
    $ forge install
```

3. **Compile the contract:**
```bash
    $ forge build
```

4. **Deploy the contract:**
```bash 
    $ forge deploy TimeLock
```

5. **Testing:**

Unit tests are included to ensure the contract's functionality. Run the tests using:
```bash
    $ forge test
```

### Customization:

You can adjust the minimum and maximum delays by modifying the MIN_DELAY and MAX_DELAY constants within the TimeLock.sol contract.

### Additional Notes:

1. This is a basic implementation of a TimeLock contract. Further features and functionalities can be added based on your specific needs.
2. Refer to the TimeLock.sol and TestTimeLock.t.sol files for detailed contract logic and test cases.

### Security Considerations:

1. Carefully evaluate the appropriate delay durations to balance security and operational efficiency.
2. Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place to restrict who can queue and execute transactions.
